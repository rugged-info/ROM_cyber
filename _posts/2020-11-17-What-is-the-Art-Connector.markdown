The Art Connector is our most recent attempt to design software that helps grass-root creators reach like-minded supporters over social media.
The first phase of our project will gather and analyze information from Twitter to advise local artists who are building communities of practice on the platform.
The second phase of the project will incorporate Facebook and Instagram.
